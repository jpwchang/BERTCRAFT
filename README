# BERTCRAFT

BERTCRAFT: requires more GPU than starcraft

Despite the name, this repository is not actually a model that combines BERT with CRAFT. Rather, it is a reimplementation of the CRAFT fine-tuning demo notebook but using BERT as the underlying language model. The data loading and evaluation using ConvoKit are kept intact from the original CRAFT notebook. This is partly meant to serve as a proof-of-concept and pilot for an upcoming implementation of a general conversational forecasting framework in ConvoKit.

COMMENTS AND MARKDOWN IN THE NOTEBOOK ARE NOT ACCURATE! Most docs were left untouched during the translation from CRAFT to BERT so the vast majority of the docs (other than in the data loading and evaluation sections) talk about CRAFT-specific things that obviously are no longer relevant in the current code.
